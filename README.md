Voice Assistant App
Overview
This project is a Voice Assistant built using Flutter that leverages OpenAI API to provide intelligent conversational capabilities. The assistant listens to user queries, processes them, and responds with natural language output, making it a robust and interactive assistant.

Features
Voice Recognition: Convert speech to text seamlessly using Flutter's built-in capabilities.
Natural Language Processing: Use the OpenAI API to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
Interactive Conversations: The assistant handles multiple query types, providing real-time responses.
Cross-Platform: Works on Android, iOS, and Web platforms using Flutter's responsive design.
Technologies Used
Flutter: The UI framework used for creating this cross-platform application.
OpenAI API: For generating natural and human-like responses to voice commands and queries.
Speech Recognition: Using plugins like speech_to_text to convert user voice input into text.
Text-to-Speech: Using flutter_tts for converting text responses back into speech.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rohanranga/voice_assist.git
cd voice_assist
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Flutter installed. Run the following command to get all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Set Up APIs:

OpenAI API: Obtain your API key from OpenAI.
Configure Environment: Create an .env file in the root of your project and add the API keys:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Run the App: For Android/iOS:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
How It Works
The app listens for user voice input, using speech_to_text to convert speech into text.
The text is sent to OpenAI's API for natural language understanding and response generation.
The response is sent back as text and converted into speech using flutter_tts for the user to hear.
